# UFOs

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

We are building an HTML page that will allow us to pull up information from a javascript data file using filters to find different UFO sightings throughout the United States based on dates, different areas, and what type of shape of the sighting.


Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

Once entering the website the person will see the basic opening and title with the picture at the top, as the client scrolls down they will begin to see all the data and 5 different filters to choose from; the date, city, state, country & shape. You can choose any of these filters enter the search bar, then the HTML page will show all of the sightings for that specific search. Multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further inspect the data in the specific search bar that is entered.

Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

The page allows the user to filter through the different sightings using the search bars created. A drawback is that the data is missing the number of people who were at the sighting. If we had how many people were at the sighting would be a helpful element to validating the claims. My two recommendations for improving this website would be:

     - To have the number of people who were at the sighting;
     - To make the search bar more effective and more professional.
